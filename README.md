## Hi I'm Nitin 👋
## I am an Undergraduate Computer Science student at George Mason University with an interest Software Engineering and Full-Stack Development.

Some Projects I have worked on!

⭐ InternConnect Backend Platform - Building a scalable Node.js/PostgreSQL backend system with JWT authentication and Dockerized deployment on AWS EC2/RDS to facilitate student-startup matching. In Progress 🚨🚨🚨

⭐ [NT News](https://github.com/NitinTammina/NT-News) - Developed a full-stack tech news platform using Next.js and Node.js with GitHub OAuth, with an Sanity CMS backend for structured content management. Check it out [here](https://nt-news-gamma.vercel.app/) 🚀

⭐ Shell Text Management System - Engineered a Unix-style shell in C with fork/exec process control and pipe-based IPC, enabling concurrent command execution. Implemented robust signal handling, error logging, and a custom parser supporting 13+ commands with background/foreground processing for enhanced system reliability 🗿.
